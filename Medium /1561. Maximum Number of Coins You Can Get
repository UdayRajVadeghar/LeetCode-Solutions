//Here the value of K is the number of times we are picking up. The best scenerio for us to have the maximum piles is that , we sort the array first and then we let alice choose the last index(highest piles) then we choose the
n-1 index (second highest ) and let bob take the first index (that is 0) only then we can get the maximum number of piles.So here I have sorted the array and got a stopper K as a variable where the valriable tells us when to stop.
we can then choose every alternative element backwards from the second last index (that is arr.length - 1). 


class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] piles) {

        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int k = piles.length / 3;
        int sum = 0 ;
        int i = 1;

        while(k>0){
            
            sum = sum + piles[piles.length - 2*i];
            k--;
            i++;
        }
        return sum;
            
    }
}
